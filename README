ask Lunpa for now if you're confused... this is pretty sketchy at the moment as we're still getting the tuning solid.

# Suggested Setup

* 195C for PLA, the thermistor is a bit off.

# Checkouts/Symlinks

## Code

Check out all 3 of these into 1 dir:

* https://github.com/pumpingstation1/mendels
* https://github.com/kliment/Printrun
* https://github.com/ahmetcemturan/SFACT

## Symlinks

* Printrun/sfact_profiles -> mendels/sfact_profiles
* Printrun/skeinforge -> ../SFACT

Eventually we'll document how to flash the tuned firmware from the mendels repository, but not yet.
