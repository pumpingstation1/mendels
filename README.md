## Code

Check out all 3 of these into 1 dir:

* https://github.com/pumpingstation1/mendels
* https://github.com/kliment/Printrun
* https://github.com/ahmetcemturan/SFACT

<A name="toc2-19" title="Symlinks" />
## Symlinks

* Printrun/sfact_profiles -> ../mendels/sfact_profiles
* Printrun/skeinforge -> ../SFACT

Eventually we'll document how to flash the tuned firmware from the mendels repository, but not yet.
